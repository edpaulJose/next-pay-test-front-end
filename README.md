# Getting Started
We have provided a bit of boilerplate code that you can use to get started. You are not required to use this boilerplate, so feel free to throw it all away and start fresh if you prefer.

Please commit your code to GitLab or Github and share with @renesansz and @mjarenyap once you're done.
# Requirements

You are tasked to create a **listing** page of available third-party integrations and your output should satisfy our minimum requirements:

1. A search functionality
2. **Pagination**. We have 25 apps and we probably only want to show a max of 10 apps per page, so we require you to implement pagination
3. A way to filter by category:
    * Accounting
    * Bookkeeping
    * Communication
    * Compliance
    * eCommerce
    * HRIS
    * Payroll

4. Randomized app listing when the page is loaded
5. Design output (see **Design** section)
6. Unit tests of your components/functionalities

## Optional
* A way to track UTMs ([Urchin Tracking Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters)). Use any third-party analytics services for this one (eg: [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/))
    * How was the user redirected to this page?
    * What are the most searched terms?
    * Which filters were frequently used?
* Mobile responsive design

## Note

You don't need an API, just derive your own way of mocking the data

# Design

Implementing our desired UI is also one of our minimum requirements, we suggest you use [MUI libraries](https://mui.com/) but you may use other UI libraries as long as you can achieve a similar design.
